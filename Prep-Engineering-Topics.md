* Just do the thing. And do it lots of times. You will learn and improve by the sheer repetition.

* Good code is measured in WTFs per minute. If someone looks at it and can understand most of what you're doing, that's good.

* Messy code starts out as "well at least it works, we can clean it up later" but can quickly (over the span of a year or two) put a company out of buisness because the code becomes too difficult to maintain.

* Good error handling and test-driven-development can help with keeping code from becoming messy.

* The scout rule of "Leave the campsite cleaner than you found it" applies to code.

# Red, Green, Refactor

* This is a method of test driven development 
    * Red - you write the test first to test what you want your code to ultimately do
    * Green - you write code that passes the test. Here you are really just looking for a solution that works.
    * Refactor - you look at your code again and see if you can make it more concise or run more efficentely.

# The Cycles of TDD

* Test driven development doesn't stop once you have a test that passes.

* You need to always be revisiting the code while it's in production and making improvments where you can.
